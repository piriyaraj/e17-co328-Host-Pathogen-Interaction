#  Inference of host-microbe associations based on metagenomic data

## overview
Finding the diesecs is very challenginig matter. There are many methods available in the filed but the problem these methods are not flow the same procedure. So that we like to develop the software that help to identify the problem using the microbiome samples. The software worked based on the machine learning techniques. It can give more suitable discussion for the user.
## problem
When considering the problems in this field we found some of the major things.
-imited to testing for differential abundance of microbial taxa between group of sample
-They do not allow users to evaluate their predictivity.
-the software resulting from these studies is generally not easily modified or transferred to other classification tasks or data types
-Some tools have identified these many issues
-Specific programming language based
-its give poor user experience
## solutions
we are suggesting a web application integrated with a machine learning framework and statistical methods.it can help user they can analyze their microbiome data without any machine learning knowledge because our software proving the GUI for doing such things
